# Quadrant Function

  # It should return 1, 2, 3, or 4, corresponding to the quadrant of the input point.
  # If the point is on the x or y axis, it should return 'x' or 'y' respectively.
  # If the point is the origin, it should return 0.
  # Please include input checking: i.e. make sure x and y are numeric.
